= Table

* `Dbinfo`
* `JdbcName` A `com.stealthsoftwareinc.sst.JdbcName` object that consists of two instances of https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html[java.lang.String], one (denoted `name`) used as the external name of that table for all parties to identify it, and one (denoted `underlyingName`) used as an internal name of the table used only by the party owning that table.
* `Columns`: A https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html[java.util.Map] from the name of the column (as a https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html[java.lang.String]) to a xref:jl_column.adoc#jl_column[Column].
* `linkingColumn`: A xref:jl_column.adoc#jl_column[Column] storing the column in the table that will be used as the join key when combining columns from this table with another table, possibly with help by another party involved in the computation.
