[#configuring_the_database_connections]
= Configuring the database connections

Each of the DB1 and DB2 servers must be able to connect to its
corresponding database.
The database connection settings are specified by the
`database_connection` object in the configuration file.

MySQL::
+
.Sample database connection settings for MySQL
[source,subs="{subs_source}"]
----
{
  "database_connection": {
    "type": "mysql",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 3306,
    "username": "pulsar",
    "password": "stealth",
    "database": "higher_ed"
  }
}
----

SQLite::

.Sample database connection settings for SQLite
[source,subs="{subs_source}"]
----
{
  "database_connection": {
    "type": "sqlite",
    "file": "higher_ed.sqlite3"
  }
}
----
+
* {empty}
If a relative path is given for `file`, it is taken relative to the
working directory from which the server was run.
+
* {empty}
Backslash characters must be escaped inside JSON strings, which is
particularly relevant on Windows.
For example, you would need to specify
`"file": "C:\\data\\higher_ed.sqlite3"`
instead of
`"file": "C:\data\higher_ed.sqlite3"`.

SQL Server::
+
.Sample database connection settings for SQL Server
[source,subs="{subs_source}"]
----
{
  "database_connection": {
    "type": "sqlserver",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 1433,
    "username": "pulsar",
    "password": "stealth",
    "database": "higher_ed"
  }
}
----
+
* {empty}
{Windows_Authentication} can be enabled by omitting the `username` and
`password` members.
